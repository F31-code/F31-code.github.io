# Welcome to F31-Docs

this is a default site I haven't fully edited.

this website doesn't really have a point, and is not exactly designed to be a documentation guide. call it an experiment if you like...

### any ideas for this site?

So, let's start, shall we?

## External Docs to get started on:
The [SYSlang Documentation & Guides](https://docs.systemwarwe.ga/SYSlang)

## My Docs:
Docs on my all new [SYSlang Colours GUI](https://f31-code.github.io/docs/syslcolor)
