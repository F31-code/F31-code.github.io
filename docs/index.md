# Welcome to F31 WebDocs

This is a default site I haven't [edited on GitHub](https://github.com/F31-code/F31-code.github.io/edit/main/index.md) but that will soon be a website for my Docs 'n' stuff.

This website doesn't really have a point, and is not exactly designed to be a documentation guide. Call it an experiment if you like...

### Some ideas for this site?

An idea for this site is a code-haven, but we'll pass on that idea... At least, for now...
