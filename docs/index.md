# Welcome to F31-Docs

this is a default site I haven't fully [edited on GitHub](https://github.com/F31-code/F31-code.github.io/edit/main/index.md) but that will soon be a website for my Docs 'n' stuff.

this website doesn't really have a point, and is not exactly designed to be a documentation guide. call it an experiment if you like...

### any ideas for this site?

an idea for this site is a code-haven, but I can't be bothered to do that, so I'll pass on that for now..

```markdown
